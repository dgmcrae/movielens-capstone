# movielens-capstone
This repository contains the three required submission files for the PH125.9x capstone unit, namely:

"McRae Movielens 2022.Rmd" - a report in the form of an Rmd file, 
"McRae-Movielens-2022.pdf" - a report in the form of a PDF document knit from the Rmd file, 
"McRae Movielens Capstone Script 2022" - an R script that generates predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE

The files are shared here for the purpose of peer grading in case they can not be downloaded directly from my submission.
